# MazeProject
Maze Game for our school project
Developing a Dynamic maze game ,that uses Algorithms ( Kruskal , Growing binary Trees and sidewinder) to generate Dynamic Perfect Mazes with different levels of difficulty and complexity. Self-resolution is done by: Backtracking algorithm

Used Technologies : QT , C++
